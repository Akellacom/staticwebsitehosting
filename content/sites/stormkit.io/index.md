Stormkit simplifies deployments of static websites as well as and application management for modern javascript apps.
	
It integrates seamlessly with your existing git flow (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) and deploys your application whenever you push to your repository.  

Inject code snippets to your documents without deploying. Changes are effective immediately.

Publish multiple deployments to perform A/B tests.

Scale infinitely - it's powered by AWS Lambdas and S3. 

Remote configuration (like Firebase for mobile apps)

Multiple environments for each application.
	
Lately, we have also redesigned the landing page which is now open source (https://github.com/stormkit-io/www-stormkit-io).
